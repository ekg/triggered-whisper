# Triggered Whisper

Triggered Whisper is a controller-optimized fork of [Whisper To Input](https://github.com/j3soon/whisper-to-input), designed for hands-free operation with Bluetooth game controllers. Perfect for AR displays and terminal workflows.

## Key Features

- **Bluetooth Controller Support**: Full button mapping for game controllers (tested with 8BitDo micro BT)
- **Modifier Key System**: R1 acts as a modifier for advanced combos
- **tmux Integration**: Built-in shortcuts for tmux window/pane management
- **Compact UI**: Minimal keyboard layout optimized for controller-only use
- **Side-by-side Installation**: Installs alongside original Whisper To Input app

## Installation

Download the latest APK: `http://hypervolu.me/www/triggered/triggered-whisper.apk`

Follow the same installation steps as [Whisper To Input](https://github.com/j3soon/whisper-to-input#installation), but select "Triggered Input" as your keyboard instead of "Whisper Input".

## Controller Button Mappings

### Basic Controls
- **L1** = Toggle recording (listen/stop)
- **Button B** = Enter/return
- **Button X** = Delete/backspace
- **Button Y** = Space
- **Button A** = Ctrl+R (fzf autocomplete)

### R1 Modifier Combos
- **R1 (hold)** = Modifier mode (shows "üîß MOD")
- **R1+L1** = New tmux pane - horizontal split (Ctrl+Q ") - shows "‚ûï NEW PANE"
- **R1+A** = Ctrl+Q only (puts tmux in command mode for arrow navigation) - shows "‚å®Ô∏è CTRL+Q"
- **R1+X** = Ctrl+D (exit/logout) - shows "üö™ CTRL+D"
- **R1+Y** = Ctrl+C (cancel/interrupt) - shows "‚ùå CTRL+C"

### Trigger Buttons
- **L2** = Ctrl+Q P (tmux previous window) - shows "‚óÄÔ∏è PREV"
- **R2** = Ctrl+Q N (tmux next window) - shows "‚ñ∂Ô∏è NEXT"

### Visual Feedback
All commands show emoji indicators in the debug display (green text area on left side of keyboard), so you can see exactly what button was pressed.

## Use Cases

- **AR Displays**: Phone in pocket, viewing terminal on AR glasses
- **Terminal Workflows**: Quick tmux navigation and voice input
- **Hands-free Operation**: Navigate and input without touching the phone

## Services

Triggered Whisper supports the same STT/ASR backends as Whisper To Input:
- OpenAI API
- Whisper ASR Webservice (self-hosted)
- NVIDIA NIM (self-hosted)

See the [original documentation](https://github.com/j3soon/whisper-to-input#services) for configuration details.
